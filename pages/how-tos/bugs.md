## What not to report
  - Bugs in unofficial builds or anything not downloaded from [our official portal](https://download.conqueros.co/)
  - Missing builds
  - Asking for installation help
  - Asking for device support

## Reporting a bug
  Reporting bugs is also important to make ConquerOS better. To reporting a bugs, you will need logcat. You can take logcat by running
```adb logcat -d > logcat.txt``` and you will get ```logcat.txt``` that ready to send to the developers. You can also send screenshot if possible!
